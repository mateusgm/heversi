    <H2> The Brain Viewer </H2>

    GeBoP features a brain viewer which enables you to explore the computer's internal game tree. To open the brain viewer, first start a game. Next, select 'Open' in the 'Brain' menu. You can open a seperate brain viewer for each open game. <BR>

    <BR>

    The brain viewer consists of two components. To the left, there is a tree view. To the right, there is a situation panel. In the tree view, you can browse the game tree. The situation panel will show statistics about the currently selected situation in the tree view. <BR>

    <BR>

    At the start, there is only one item in the tree view, called 'current situation'. If you double click this item, a list will expand with all possible moves for the current player. Each item represents a new situation. In turn, you can expand these new items with a list with all possible moves for the next player in this new situation. <BR>

    <BR>

    Each item in the tree view has an icon which tells you which player would make the move in question. The best moves, based on the computer's current information, are displayed with a highlighted icon. Next to the icon is the move. This can be grey, black or bold. If it is grey, it means that it has not yet been seen by the computer. If it is black, it has been seen. If it is bold, it means that this situation has been completely computed, that every possible compination of moves from that point on has been seen. <BR>

    <BR>

    The situation panel on the right side of the brain viewer consists of three parts. The upper part shows an icon for the player who has to move in this situation. Next to it is a bar that shows the value of this situation. The middle part shows the complete depth, the maximum depth and the volume of this situation. The complete depth states how many sublevels of this situation have been completely computed. The maximim depth states the depth of the deepest sublevel that has been computed yet. The volume is the number of computed subsituations. Finally, the lower part consists of a graphical representation of the current situation, the way it looks in the normal game window. You can actually make moves in this part, this will result in selecting another situation in the tree view. <BR>
