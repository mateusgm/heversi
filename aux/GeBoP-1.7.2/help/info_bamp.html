    <H2> Bamp Information </H2>

    This is a game I designed myself. GeBoP supports games where the order in which the players move depends on the moves, and is not fixed a priori. However, I could not find such a game anywhere... <BR>

    The reason might be that it is very difficult to plan a strategy in such a game, since you never know when you will be allowed to move again. Still, it is interesting to study this type of games.
