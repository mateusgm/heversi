    The object is to have more pieces in your color than your oponent. To do this you can move your pieces around. You can either move a piece to an adjacent square, it will then create a copy of itself. Alternatively, you can move a piece two squares away. After moving your piece, all pieces adjacent to the destination square will turn your color. When you can't move you have to skip your turn. When you can move you have to move.
