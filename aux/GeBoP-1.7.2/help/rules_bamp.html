    <H2> Bamp Rules </H2>

    In Bamp, there is one ball, and a number of squares in four colors. The board is devided in four quadrants, each belonging to a player. When the ball is in your quadrant, you have to make a move. If you can't, you win. <BR>

    <BR>

    You make a move by selecting one of your square pieces that is in the same row or column as the ball. The piece will move to the position where the ball is, and the ball will move as far as possible in the same direction. If it ends up in another quadrant, another player moves.
