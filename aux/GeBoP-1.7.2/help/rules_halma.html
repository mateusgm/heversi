    <H2> Halma Rules </H2>

    The object of Halma is to be the first player to bring all your
    pieces to the other end of the board.
    You can move your pieces forward and sideward, but not backwards.
    Instead of just moving, you can also jump over any number of
    other pieces. Just point where you want to go.
