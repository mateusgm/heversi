    <H2> Kram Rules </H2>

    In Kram, there are two players who must place rectangular pieces on the
    board. One of the players may only place them horizontally, while the
    other player must place the pieces vertically. Each piece is the size of
    two squares on the board. The object of the game is to place more pieces
    than your opponent. To place a piece, click on the square where you want
    the left or upper half of your piece to be.
