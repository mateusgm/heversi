    Every move you put a piece onto the board, such that you surround a line of your opponents pieces.
    The line can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
    After you put your piece onto the board, all od the surrounded piecs become your color.
    If you can make no legal move, you must skip your turn.
    If you can make a legal move, you may not skip your turn.
