    <H2> Zenix Rules </H2>

    In Zenix, you have to make the highest connected chain of pieces in your color. Placing the pieces is subject to gravity, so you can only place a piece at the bottom or on top of two adjacent other pieces. <BR>

    <BR>

    A chain must always start at the bottom row, and go upward. The highest piece of your color that is connected with the bottom row, is the one that determines your score.
